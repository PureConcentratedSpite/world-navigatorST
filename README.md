"# world-navigatorST" 

A 'world-navigator' extension for sillyTavern. It takes coordinate data from a x,y coordinate plane and then uses a World Info .JSON file to calculates position, distances, direction, orientation, and field of view to help ground RP

I'll add more, once I have an idea if I want more features to be present or not.
